 *  Pointer : Show the basic declaration of pointer :
-------------------------------------------------------
 Here is m=10, n and o are two integer variable and *z is an integer

 z stores the address of m  = 0x7ffd40630d44

 *z stores the value of m = 10

 &m is the address of m = 0x7ffd40630d44

 &n stores the address of n = 0x7ffd40630d48

 &o  stores the address of o = 0x7ffd40630d4c

 &z stores the address of z = 0x7ffd40630d50
